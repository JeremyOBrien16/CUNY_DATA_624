Our New Seed : 58677


So we have 11 chosen models altogether...we have two options
1. vote to purge one of the ones with one vote other than Linear Regression  
2. 	One of us does three insead of two. 

As for me, my thought is purge Random Forest as we are bagging, boosting, cubing already!

What do you guys think?
