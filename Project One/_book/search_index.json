The variable Cash is provided in hundreds of dollars, other than that it is straight forward. I am being somewhat ambiguous on purpose. I am giving you data, please provide your written report on your findings, visuals, discussion and your R code all within a Word readable document, except the forecast which you will put in an Excel readable file.
