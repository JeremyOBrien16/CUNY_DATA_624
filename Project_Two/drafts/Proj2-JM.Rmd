# Introduction

This project was designed to evaluate a production data set from a beverage manufacturing company. Our goal is to accurately predict the Key Performance Indicator (KPI), `PH`, through predictive modeling. A score set that consists of 267 cases was also provided and will be used to score our final model.

# Data Exploration 

We were provided with a file containing 2,571 rows/cases of data and 33 columns / variables.

## Response Variable

Understanding the influence PH has on our predictors is key to building an accurate predictive model. PH is a measure of acidity/alkalinity that must conform in a critical range.
